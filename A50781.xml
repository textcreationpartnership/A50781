         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS following Treatiſe, is a Subject that lies ſo wholly whithin Your own Province of Honour, that it pretends a kind of Right to lay it ſelf at Your Excellencies Feet For though in general it relates the happy Managery<pb facs="tcp:46480:3"/>of the laſt Years Succeſſes in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet ſince that cannot be done without publiſhing ſome juſt Teſtimonials of the Courage, Fidelity, and Services of my Worthy Friend Collonel <hi>John Michelburn,</hi> methinks it is a piece of Duty (as the Pendant always attends the Flag) to uſher his Bannoret under Your Standard. And truly there's ſome farther Plea for my preſumption, in this Dedication, <hi>viz.</hi> That I may juſtly avow, that Collonel's Early Endeavours in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were at leaſt the <hi>Phoſphore</hi> to Your Excellencies brighter Sun. His forward Hand gave the firſt fair Earneſt for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Succeſſes, when in his Exemplary Northern Services, his Preſervation of <hi>London-derry,</hi> I may properly ſay, like a true <hi>Forlorn Hope,</hi> he held the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in play, till Your Excellencies heavier Maſs of Glory could come up to ſweep the intire Victory. A Victory indeed, in which the World muſt do You this publick Juſtice, that the whole laſt Years Renown was entirely Your own. For whilſt in all the other Scenes of War, as <hi>Germany, Flanders, Savoy,</hi> &amp;c. Fortune in a manner kept wholly<pb facs="tcp:46480:3"/>neuter, and the reſt of the Neighbouring Heroes only ſtood at a Bay, Your Excellencies more Active Arme held the moſt prevailing Sword, and only play'd the Conquering Game, whilſt an entire Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory follow'd no Chariot but Your own.</p>
            <p>And as long as the <hi>Compleat Reduction of Ireland</hi> fills ſo large a Page in the <hi>Engliſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> Your Excellencies never dying Merit muſt ſtand Chronicled with ſo fair a Character, that they muſt give You this peculiar Renown, That you made not War a Trade: You felt the Cauſe You fought; and in the Service of <hi>England,</hi> conſulted the Intereſt of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> whilſt the Expedition of Your Triumph is poſſibly the brighteſt of Your Lawrels.</p>
            <p>But alas! 'Tis not my Province to be Your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies Herauld or Hiſtorian; there's no occaſion for my poor Pen to attempt what all Tongues are already full of. 'Tis enough that with the Fame You have all the Vertues of a Conquerour, and as ſuch, this Gentleman's Cauſe can not come before

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THough this following <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> (as it contains a perfect Series of the moſt important Affairs that were tranſacted in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> the laſt Campaigne; and conſequently relates the Succeſs of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms in that Kingdom; ſo much conduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the happineſs of our own) cannot but be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining Subject to every honeſt Reader; yet the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this enſuing Narrative is not altogether on that deſign. The Vindication of a private Cauſe of the Honourable Coll. <hi>John Michelburne,</hi> a Perſon ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Inſtrumental in the Recovery of <hi>Ireland,</hi> has in ſome meaſure been the Motive that engag'd this preſent Pen to be drawn in his Defence. Vertue does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meet with Juſtice from the Mouth of ill tongu'd Fame; Her Enemies are often ſo ſucceſsful (Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Envy ſtill ſtriking at the nobleſt Merit) that in the falſe Game they play, the Honeſt ſide is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on the Looſing hand, and the Innocent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its fall from the Treacherous ſtab of envious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and ſucceſsful Villany. Now it being the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Honourable Perſon I have mention'd, to<pb facs="tcp:46480:5"/>be unworthily a Sufferer in this kind, you will find that whilſt this Treatiſe I am writing, gives you an exact Relation from day to day, of the manner and means he us'd to reduce <hi>Sligoe,</hi> which was taken by him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding there in chief; it will not only ſatisfie the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of thoſe that are pleaſed to look nicely into thoſe Affairs in general, but will do a particular Juſtice to his Honour, (whoſe Services have deſerv'd a much Kinder Treatment, than hitherto they have met with) by unloading him of thoſe notorious Injuries that moſt unjuſtly ill-minded Men had thrown upon him.</p>
            <p>Coll. <hi>Michelburne</hi> being impower'd by the Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the General, to command all the Forces of the Province of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> after he had made his ſecond Attack againſt the Garriſon he lay before, without that Succeſs he expected, which was occaſioned by ſome of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia's cowardly deſerting him, a very hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true Character of his Management in that Affair, (by what means tranſmitted we know not) was ſent over to Her Majeſty, which repreſented him ſo faulty, that the Queen immediately ſent particular Orders to the L. Juſtices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to take the matter into their Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Cognizance and Examination. I having the good fortune to be an Intimate Acquaintance of his, was much ſurpriz'd and troubled to hear the rumour of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome Untruths (as I conceiv'd 'em) that ſeem'd to blacken ſo my Friends unſpotted Honour; My reſpect therefore for a Perſon who was ſo early a Defender of His Majeſty's Intereſt in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to<pb facs="tcp:46480:5"/>whoſe Vigilancy, Courage, Conduct, and Fidelity the moſt happy Succeſs we met with at <hi>London-derry,</hi> next under God, ought chiefly to be attributed, woud not ſuffer me to joyn with the unthinking Populace in that Cry againſt him. But on the contrary, I was reſolved to continue the ſame Honourable Opinion of him, that his former actions had eſtabliſh'd in me, believing it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Perſon that had ſo lately ſignalized him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, cou'd ever deviate from the Paths of his innate Vertue, and unſhaken Loyalty; being firm in this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and zealous for my Friends' Honour, I could not forbear enquiring by a Letter from him, what effects this Calumny might have on his Affairs in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and whither, as yet he had healed his wounded Reputation-before the Lords Juſtices. I ſoon received a very ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Anſwer, with a Copy of a Letter from Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Ginkell</hi> to him (which you will find inſerted hereafter in its proper place) ſo much applauding the Collonel's ſignal Services, that it rejoyc'd me to know, that the malice of his ill-minded Enemies, cou'd not divert his Excellency from conceiving the ſame fair Character of him, that all juſt Men ought. But what pleas'd me moſt was to underſtand, that the Lords Juſtices (after he had three publick hearings before their Lordſhips) where he was fully acquitted, had ſent a Lerter to my Lord <hi>Nottingham</hi> in his Vindication, which was in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Her Majeſty's, that commanded them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect into the Collonel's Miſcariages. This indeed was a great ſatisfaction to me, but notwithſtanding<pb facs="tcp:46480:6"/>all this, conſidering how hard it is when vulgar Tongues are ſet a barking, to lay the cry, and that this Letter to the Queen in his Favour, might not be generally known; for want of which, the publick Clamours are not yet wholly ſilenc'd, and his Enemies through that advantage may ſtill carry on their private Intrigues to his diſhonour; I have therefore prevailed with him to deliver into my Hands what Papers he had relating to the Tranſactions, where he commanded in Chief, as well all Orders and Letters that were ſent him from the Lords Juſtices, and the General, with his Anſwer to 'em, and thoſe which paſs'd betwixt him and Sir <hi>Teague O Regan,</hi> and others relating to the Military Affairs; as alſo the Journal of his own Procedings, which I have here with his leave taken the boldneſs to print, with his Tryal in the Cloſe, thereby not only to ſatisfie the World of the juſt meaſures he took in reducing ſo important a place as <hi>Sligoe,</hi> the Key of <hi>Connaught;</hi> but likewiſe to make his Reparation as publick as his Injuries.</p>
            <p>When the Impartial <hi>Reader</hi> ſhall have peruſed this following Narration, he will eaſily perceive on what a weak Foundation they had built their hopes of ruining this much injur'd Gentleman, when the height of their deſpiſed malice durſt but aim at forging ſo poor a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal on him, as Plundering. Why did they not aſperſe him for want of Conduct or Courage? Oh! no, in both thoſe Capacities they thought he ſtood too viſibly above their feeble Batteries, and even this mean Chagre they Iay'd againſt him, how did they aim in vain to make<pb facs="tcp:46480:6"/>it out? Why even thus. The Grand Intriguers of this pitiful Deſign, were <hi>Forward</hi> and <hi>Vaughan,</hi> two Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Captains under the Collonel's Command againſt <hi>Sligo,</hi> Men of ſo Renowned a Character, that they were both notoriouſly famous for quitting their Poſts (which is vulgarly call'd running away) when in all probability he was juſt on the point of reducing <hi>Sligoe,</hi> of which Notorious Cowardice, being Accuſed by Coll. <hi>Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> theſe worthy Malecontents, to be reveng'd for the juſt Diſgrace he had thrown upon them, enter'd into a Conſpiracy againſt him, with one <hi>George Rob,</hi> an Inconſiderable Varlet, that the Collonel had threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd with Hanging, for privately Converſing with the Enemy, and ſelling them Tobacco.</p>
            <p>But whilſt theſe three wretched Confederates were hatching their Villanies, they were in a great ſtrait how to have 'em brought to light, for the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was ſo well ſatisfied of Coll. <hi>Michelburne's</hi> Worth and Honour, that no Juſtice of Peace wou'd take any Affidavits againſt him, inſomuch that <hi>Vaughan</hi> himſelf was forc't to act that part, and after he had taken ſuch weak Informations as were then new coin'd againſt him by this wretched <hi>Triumviri,</hi> the Diminitive Tobacco Merchant was immediately diſpatcht away, on this Mighty Embaſſy to <hi>Dublin.</hi> As to what happened thereupon, and how fully his impertinent Evidence was anſwer'd, <hi>I</hi> refer you to the reading of the Collonel's Tryal before the Lords Juſtices. And now becauſe I have hinted in the preceding part of this Preface, what<pb facs="tcp:46480:7"/>Fame is owing to that Exemplary Service, was done by this Honourable Perſon in the Memorable Siege of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donderry,</hi> I will give the Reader to underſtand what Part he acted in that Memorable Siege.

            <p>By break of day we came to <hi>Mulloughmore</hi> mid-way, between <hi>Ballyſhanan</hi> and <hi>Sligoe,</hi> and about five came to the <hi>Grange,</hi> where the Collonel poſted all the Foot in the old Walls of the <hi>Grange</hi> in Ambuſh, commanded by Lieut. Coll. <hi>Staughton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we halted and drew up, by reaſon of ſome difficulty whilſt we were at <hi>Muloughore,</hi> ſome Diſputes were ſtarted by Capt. <hi>Forward,</hi> and ſome of the Militia, of what ill conſequence it would be if the Enemy ſhould give us a Defeat, that moſt part of the <hi>North ſay</hi> open to the Incusſions of the Enemy, the ſubſtance of which was diſcours'd with to the Collonel, by Captain <hi>Henry Hart;</hi> the Collonel made anſwer, it was a ſhame to turn back, ſince they were half way: As alſo, why did not they object this at the Court-Martial; but ſaid, he would go if he had no more than the ſtanding Army, and thoſe of the Militia as would not follow him, they might turn back; but if they would truſt to his Management, they need not in the leaſt doubt; for his buſineſs was not to fight the Enemy, but to know if <hi>Sligoe</hi> were deſerted. And accordingly, as ſoon as the Foot were poſted, by way of Ambuſh, the Collonel takes all the Horſe and Dragoons with him, and mounts about Forty of his Granadeers on the Officers Horſes; he having about ſeven ſhort Miles to <hi>Sligo,</hi> he march'd with that Precipitation, that it was impoſſible to be ſurprized by the Enemy, leaving Seouts on every Hill, till he arrived within a Mile of <hi>Sligoe;</hi> where obſerving no Horſe appear, he advanc'd nearer, and obſer'vd about 3 or 400 Foot drawn out, by which means he diſcover'd, that <hi>Sligoe</hi> was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46480:12"/>not deſerted, as was reported: the Collonel continued before the Town above an hour, and then march'd back; 'twas very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, to march 20 Miles, and eſpecially when we march'd ſo private, not ſo much as to meet with one Perſon to give us Intelligence.</p>

               <p>I had almoſt ommited a material Paſſage which was, when Coll. <hi>Michelburne</hi> ſent to give Orders for Lieut. Coll. <hi>Ramſey,</hi> Governour of <hi>Eneskillen,</hi> to joyn him with a 100 Firelocks; on their March to <hi>Manner-Hamilton,</hi> an Expreſs met them from the Coll. acquainting them that he could not poſſible joyn them, and ſo ordered them to return back; but thoſe of Coll. <hi>Ramſey</hi>'s being a good Party, and with them a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Militla, which were never wanting on ſuch an occaſion to hunt for Prey, proſecuted their Journey to <hi>Killkenny,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Terrerah,</hi> a Barony joyning to <hi>Killkenny,</hi> they brought off a confiderable Booty of Gattle, Horſes, and Sheep; in the mean time the Garriſon of <hi>Sligoe</hi> was alarm'd, Sir <hi>Teague</hi> and Coll. <hi>Scot</hi> being advertiſed of the number of the Soldiers, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Militia that was with them, laid wait for them with 500 Foot: Coll. <hi>Michelbourne</hi> being fearful, leaſt the Garriſon of <hi>Sligoe</hi> ſhould ſally out, and fall on them at unawares, ſends a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of about 200 Horſe and Dragoons, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> to joyn the former Party; by whoſe vigilant Travelling all Night, they luckily fell in when the <hi>Eniskillen</hi> Party, and Sir <hi>Ieague O Regan</hi> were engag'd; at the appearance of Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> both Parties deſiſted, and ſtood in a maze; and that at the ſame time, when the <hi>Eniskilieners</hi> were in a likelihood to have been totally loſt; for that Coll. <hi>Scot</hi> was juſt come up with his Regiment to joyn Sir <hi>Teague;</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:46480:16"/>but it was not long, till one might judge on whoſe fide the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory wou'd fall, for the whole Party of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fled, and out Militia after them for above four Miles; but Sir <hi>Teague</hi> was the foremoſt Man, and juſt at the Entrance of the Town of <hi>Sligoe,</hi> a Serjeant of the Dragoons ſeized on one <hi>matholland,</hi> the Store-Keeper of <hi>Sligoe,</hi> who was with Sir <hi>Teague,</hi> and not half a Piſtol ſhot from him; but the Honourable Sir <hi>Teagne O Regan,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Town and County of <hi>Sligoe,</hi> won the Race: This <hi>Matholland</hi> that was taken Priſoner by the Serjeant, told him, Who do you think that Crook'd-back Fellow was who rid before? The Serjeant reply'd, he believed him to be his Servant: The <hi>Devil</hi> take me, quoth <hi>Matholland,</hi> but he was Sir <hi>Teague O Regan;</hi> By my Soul, quoth the Serjeant, 'tis 20 Guineas out of my way; for I am ſure the General would have rewarded me very well. Sir <hi>Teague</hi> ſwore, that if they ever carch'd Sir <hi>Teague</hi> ſo far again, he would agree to be crack'd as a Hog oracks a Pottato. At this time, by the earneſt purſuit after the Enemy, one Lieut. <hi>Patrick Macre,</hi> formerly a Lieut. in <hi>Dorry,</hi> during the time of the Siege, purſuing the Enemy into the Town, apprehending ſtill he was among his own Men, cry'd out for King <hi>William's</hi> Boys, and the Honour of <hi>London-Derry;</hi> the poor Man was miſtaken, and knook'd down by the Enemy; but accidentally one of the Towns Men knew him, and had him before Sir <hi>Teague.</hi> Sir <hi>Teague</hi> ask'd him his Name; quoth the Lieut my Name is <hi>Patrick Moore:</hi> Then Sir <hi>Teague</hi> enquired what he was: He told him he was a Servant in <hi>Derry;</hi> and enquiring after all things, he ask'd him who was Governour in <hi>Derry:</hi> Hotold him Coll. <hi>Michelburne;</hi> to whom he expreſs'd great kindneſs, and allow'd him good Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which civility afterwards was Requited by Coll. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelburne.</hi> But to purſue our Diſcourſe, from the Enemy we took 16 Priſoners, which were brought by Guard to <hi>Ballyſhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou.</hi> Sir <hi>Teague</hi> was not long before he heard who had his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and ſent this following Letter to Sir <hi>Francis Hamilion.</hi>

               <p>Since we are Concerned with the Militia of the Northern Parts,
'tis not amiſs to give you an Account, that for the better ordering of the Militia, there were three Superiors ordered to inſpect them, <hi>Coll.

Murray</hi> had undertaken with the Lords Juſtices to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Connaught</hi> with a conſiderable Body of Men, and not to leſſen the Militia to incommode the Rebels, and 'twas generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd, that the Body of his Men were to conſiſt of 5000 Horſe and Foot, but how that could have been accompliſht cannot well be underſtood; for when all the Militia of the Countrey was ſummon'd by the Lords Juſtices Orders to joyn <hi>Coll. Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:46480:19"/>at <hi>Ballyſhannon,</hi> and then to joyn the Lord <hi>Granard</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they could not make 500; but we had two ſorts of Services, that of defending the Frontiers, and that of getting Prey; for wherever a deſign was for Plunder there you had twenty for one. It was thereſors thought not convenient for <hi>Coll. Murray</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Connaught,</hi> but to joyn his Militia on the Frontiers, as by a Letter from <hi>Coll.

                     <p>I Wrote to you laſt Week concerning the Surrender of <hi>Sligoe,</hi> but ſince I receiv'd an Expreſs from the General, which I have ſent you to peruſe; you may ſee what fair Terms are propoſed both to Officers and Soldiers. I preſume you are not ignorant of the Surrender of <hi>Gallway,</hi> and the great advantage they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by an early Complying with Their Majeſties Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and what further they in Reaſon deſired. I come now with Authority from Their Majeſties and the General, to offer you what reaſonable Conditions you deſire, as well for Officers as Soldiers, hoping you will Commiſerate the ſad and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition the Country lyes under, which muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſink into Ruin without your ſpeedy Complyance; I have taken all poſſible care to preſerve the poor Inhabitants, by giving Protections, or otherways; and my Buſineſs is not to plunder and prey, to the ruin of the Country, as ſome from <hi>Eniskillin</hi> and <hi>Bellurbit,</hi> have not long ago done; but for the<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46480:21"/>Preſervation and Safeguard of it; we allow you may keep your Fort, till ſuch time as ſome Cannon and Mortars may be brought againſt it, and then it may be for Two or Three days, and no more; for if <hi>Gallway</hi> and <hi>Athlone</hi> could not hold out, we may judge by your Reſiſtance, that you deſign the Deſolation of your Country; your own Force cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you long, and your Army is entirely defeated: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeriouſly conſider, if you abuſe not the Grace that is offered to you, what advantages may accrue, as well to your ſelf, your Officers and Soldiers, as to the Country, and Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? In this I have done my duty, and deſire to know your Reſolution, that I may make a report of it to the General, which is all at preſent from,</p>

               <p>Theſe Letters paſſing between the <hi>Coll.</hi> and Garriſon, and the aforeſaid meeting agreed to, of <hi>Coll. Scott, Coll. Ternon O Rourke,</hi> and Lieut. Coll. <hi>O Rourke</hi> of their ſide; of ours <hi>Coll. Michelburne,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> Lieut. of the County of <hi>Dunigall,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Hugh Caldwell,</hi> where we had a Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for near an hour, it being concluded to, that Sir <hi>Teague</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhould be granted to ſend away a Meſſenger with Letters to the Duke of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> whoſe Approbation was to be taken therein, but conditionally to be firſt viewed by the General, About 6 that Evening we drew off from the Town, at which time the Coll. was told, that ſome Troops of the Militia had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their Poſts, and were gone a plundering: On inquiry, he was further inform'd, they were thoſe Commanded by Capt. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> and that Capt. <hi>Forward</hi> and <hi>Vaughan</hi> were miſſing: Now conſidering the number of Men the Coll. had with him, and that he ſhould ſoon want Proviſions, being wholly unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, when we came out, he Detached Eight Men out of each Troop, under the Command of Capt. <hi>Anthony Shamborge,</hi> Capt. of Granadeers, to follow the Troops which had left their Poſts without Orders, and to bring in ſome Cattle for ſubſiſtance to the Men, but inſtead of theſe half the Militia ſtole away, ſo that that Night when we were marcht back to <hi>Killowny,</hi> and incampt there, it was as much as the two Troops of the ſtanding Army could do to keep the few that were left of the Militia together: Next Morning they continuing to break off at all ſides, the Collonel ſoon found that it was in vain for him longer to depend on any but his own Foot, and thoſe two Troops of Dragoons, if any thing ſhould happen, we being already in a manner left alone. About two hours after, the Collonel had an Account of two Troops, one Commanded by Capt. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and another by <hi>Henderſon;</hi> that with a Prey of about 100 Cows, and 2 or
300 Sheep, with ſome Horſes, were marching intire with the Prey to their own home; on which, he ſent about 30 Foot, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took them about 3 Miles from <hi>Killowny,</hi> but they would not be ſtopt till the Coll. was forc'd to ſend a ſtronger Party, who brought the Prey into our Camp: Our Men were well ſtored with Proviſions, by whieh means the Coll. ſecur'd two Troops of<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46480:22"/>the Militia, which you ſee had quite left him. Captain <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borge</hi> with his Party, returned this day with about 7 or 800 Cows; but the day being <hi>Sunday,</hi> proving very wet, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there that Night. He reſolved to give the General an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in what manner he proſecuted his Deſign in going to <hi>Sligoe</hi> the ſecond time, Major <hi>Hamilton,</hi> as I told you before, having Orders from Coll. <hi>Michelburne</hi> to detach 100 Firelocks from the Garriſon of <hi>Bellurbitt, Eniskillin, Cavan,</hi> &amp;c. out of his own Regiment to Re-inforce the 200 he brought with him from <hi>Ballyſhannon;</hi> and Two Troops of Dragoons: Theſe 300 Men, with the Militia, appearing before <hi>Sligoe</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1691. was an extraordinary Incouragement to the Coll. to Attack them the ſecond time; it was agreed upon the Night before, that a Lieut, from Coll. <hi>Michelburne,</hi> and one from the Garriſon ſhould depart immediately to the General with theſe Letters from Sir <hi>Teague,</hi> the Coll. ſending this following Letter to the General.</p>

               <p>The Major, as I told you before, joyned the Coll, with a Hundred Firelocks, ſo that they were now about Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot who marched back to <hi>Sligoe</hi> together with the Militia, bringing all the Prey along with them; for he concluded, no Prey, no Militia; we having arrived there about 10, the Coll. divided his whole Party in two Bodies, about Four Hundred Men in each, the one he Ranged on the top of a Hill, with which he deſigned to paſs the River at Ebb-water: In the mean time he block'd up the Weſt part of the Town, with the other Four Hundred Men; and having viewed well the Ground, he poſted them on ſuch places as he thought moſt proper. He could at the ſame time have entred the Town, but apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill Conſequences that might have happen'd, if the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had taken to plunder, which undoubtedly they would, he gave Orders on pain of Death, not one to enter the Town.

The Collonel told them, that he expected more to join, for that the Expreſſes that went to the General, would ſoon be back; and that it would be but eight Days, and the Town would be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred. The Camp was now like a Fair, Buying and Selling, Robbing and Stealing the Sheep in the Night, and killing them for their Skins. The Collonel was adviſed to divide the Prey, or elſe he would have none left; the very Officers and Soldiers that was Guard of the Cattle, ſelling them in the Night. The Collonel was for ſelling ſome of them, and ſending for Meal to make Bread, and thoſe that would not ſtay, ſhould have none: but the Officers were againſt it, as well as the Soldiers: The Collonel ordered Capt. <hi>William Stewart,</hi> to make a Dividend, the whole being counted, were 585.</p>

This Diſcourſe has been the more tedious, by reaſon ſome malicious people of the Militia, to cover their own guilt, have endeavoured to Aſperſe and Villifie the Collonel, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral falſe Informations given in againſt him to the Government.</p>
               <p>This day being the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Col. <hi>Michelburne</hi> drew off his Detachment on <hi>Connaught</hi> ſide of <hi>Sligoe:</hi> (Occaſion'd by <hi>Ballderrog O Donnel</hi>'s Advance to relieve the Town) and joyn'd them with thoſe of <hi>Ballyſhanan</hi> ſide, and call'd his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers together where was conſidred,</p>

1000.</p>
               <p>Of our ſide, conſidering the 12 Troops of Dragoons and two Foot Companys of the Militia that left us, we were in no way able to make a defence, meeting with ſo much diſincou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement; and that we were but a handful in compariſon of the Enemy. The ſtrength we had then not exceeding four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: 'twas agreed the next morning to march back to <hi>Bally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhanan,</hi> and return with a ſtronger Body than formerly, for the Malitia would no queſtion, but be very ambitious to ſee the Surrender of the Town and Fort of <hi>Sligoe.</hi> So on the <hi>10th</hi> Inſtant, the Collonel broke up Bamp, and that Night march to <hi>Ballyſhanan.</hi>

Soon after <hi>Ballder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rog O Donnel</hi> appears, with about ten Horſe; the Collonel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with about the ſame number, and with him, Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> Cornet <hi>Mead,</hi> Captain <hi>Charles Hamilton, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>O Donnel</hi>'s Speech tending to this effect.</p>
               <q>That he did not deny but that there was a Treaty between Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Ginkell</hi> and himſelf; but he was not come to any Concluſion as yet, and that he expected very good Terms, as well for his Followers, as for himſelf; and that as the Gariſon of <hi>Sligoe</hi> was in diſpute, he thought it would be neceſſary that a middle Perſon, meaning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, be put in poſſeſſion; and that Collonel <hi>Michelburne</hi> ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Articles with Sir <hi>Teige,</hi> and conduct him ſafe to <hi>Lymerick;</hi> and that in ten, or fifteen days time, he would deliver up the Fort to him, or whoever General <hi>Ginkell</hi> ſhould appoint.</q>
               <p>The Collonel told him, He underſtood that Sir <hi>Teige O Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> was capable, and of Authority ſufficient to make good the Articles that was between them; if he could not, Why was there not a clauſe in the Articles? The Collonel ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46480:37"/>that the Gariſon and he were in diſpute, for they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny'd him poſſeſſion. <hi>O Donnel,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> riding aſide, the Collonel told him, That according to the General's Letter, he underſtood that he was to aſſiſt him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Gariſon, if in caſe they prov'd obſtinate; ſo that he preſum'd 'twas his buſineſs to perſuade them to ſurrender to him, and not to take poſſeſſion for himſelf, which did not anſwer at all the General's Letter, and gave <hi>O Donnel</hi> the General's Letter to read, and that nothing ſhould be wanting on the General's ſide, wherein was mentioned the paying him two hundred Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, which he ſhould have in a day or two's time. <hi>O Donnel</hi> made anſwer, That he would conſult Sir <hi>Teige,</hi> and return an anſwer the next day in the Morning. So returning to the reſt of the Officers; the Collonel treated <hi>O Donnel</hi> with ſome Sherry and Uſquebath, and parted.</p>
               <p>The next Day Collonel <hi>Michelburne</hi> met <hi>O Donnel</hi> at the place appointed, and after ſome diſcourſe they rid off. The Collonel delivered him 100 Guineys, and promiſed him in a day or two's time, to pay him the remainder, according to the General's Orders, and deſired to know what he reſolved upon, for that Sir <hi>Teige</hi> was ready to ſurrender the Fort, if he would agree to it. His anſwer was, That 'till his People had conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as himſelf, he would not at all agree that Sir <hi>Teige</hi> ſhould deliver up the Fort. Coll. <hi>Michhlburne</hi> wondred ſtrange, and told him, That he which ſhould aſſiſt, if occaſion was, to oblige them to Surrender, was the only Man that obſtructed it; he deſir'd that he would draw his Forces from the Town, and let him, and the Gariſon, try Titles. He anſwered, not at all, and if he would agree, his People would not allow it, but take part with the Gariſon; but withal told the Colonel, That aſſoon as he he had made an end with Collonel <hi>Richards,</hi> he would then come and aſſiſt him to reduce the place. So they parted, and <hi>O Donnel</hi> went to his Camp: By the diſcord that was between Sir <hi>Teige O Regan</hi> and <hi>O Donnel,</hi> the Collonel was ſtill in hopes ſomething might be done with Sir <hi>Teige;</hi> he therefore ſends a Drumer into Town, with Letters to this effect.</p>

                     <p>MY Major, whom I ſent with the Articles to your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lney to be ſigned, returned on the 14th. The Town was to be delivered the next Morning: I ſent Sir <hi>Teige</hi> the incloſed, who anſwered mine on the back; and according to Sir <hi>Teige</hi>'s deſire, I diſeours'd <hi>Ballderrog,</hi> called amongſt them my Lord <hi>O Donnel,</hi> who ſignified by his Diſcourſe, That as the Gariſon was in diſpute, his advice was, That a middle Perſon, meaning h mſelf, between both, be placed in the Town and Fort, and withal did acknowledge, that there had been ſome Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46480:39"/>him and General <hi>Ginkel</hi> in behalf of Himſelf and Followers; and if I would condeſcend, he would be put in poſſeſſion of the Town and Forts, and I to perform Articles to conduct the ſaid Garriſon to <hi>Limrick;</hi> I told him as to any thing elſe, I was ready to ſerve his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but my buſineſs there was to performe Articles with the Garriſon, and I expected they would do the ſame with me; after ſome diſcourſe, I rid off with <hi>Ballderrog,</hi> and ſhew'd him your Excellencies Letter, and preſented him with one hundred Guineas of the two hundred your Excellency order'd me to pay him, and the other hundred ſhould be at his Lordſhips Service in a day or two. His diſcourſe was ſtill to be in poſſeſſion of the Garriſon: I told him your Letter mention'd no more than to joyn me in caſe they were Refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. And ſince there was no occaſion, either his ſaying he would not relieve them or drawing off his men would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; I put it to him to know if he came there to relieve or not, and to know whether he was our Friend or Enemy; he told me next morning he would give me full ſatis faction, in every thing. I deſired then there might be a Ceſſation of Arms. My Lord <hi>Ballderrog</hi> went that night to the Camp; early in the morning I ſent the ſecond Letter to Sir <hi>Teige,</hi> whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is incloſed, and finding him ſo inlinable, I ſent my Major to compound all thoſe little Buſineſſes between us, and to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them fully in money, but when he came there, unexpected he found the Lord <hi>Ballderrog</hi> who ſent away the Major immediately to me, to meet his Lordſhip between the two Lines, where we again met, and after ſome diſcourſes we again rid off: he told me that he was ſo far ingag'd to K. <hi>William,</hi> that he could not with Honour break off, but however ſeveral of his Officers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected good Terms, and as much advantage as others; I told him that the Surrender of the Garriſon to me, would be no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, for that you were eaſier dealt with by fair means than foul, and that I muſt acquaint you that he was the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that did obſtruct the Surrender, and appeared our open Enemy, after taſting ſo largly of your favours. He told me he could not agree to the Surrender till his Officers were ſatisfied<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46480:40"/>as well as himſelf. I have ſent incloſed an Inſtrument of <hi>Ballder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogs,</hi> without which they would have ſurrendred; when the Major ſaw his falſeneſs to your Excellency, and taking money and yet acting as an open Enemy, he gave Sir <hi>Teige</hi> and Col. <hi>Scott</hi> an account of his ingagement to you, and his receiving money from me. They bleſt themſelves and ſaid he was a Knave on both ſides. The Militia of this Line are every one gone of their own accord home, and I have only theſe two Troops to aſſiſte me, in this forty miles diſtance. I was forced to take them with me to <hi>Sligoe,</hi> intending to ſend them the neareſt way to <hi>Athlone,</hi> in caſe the Gariſon of <hi>Sligoe</hi> had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred in purſueance to your Excellencies Potent. If you would be pleaſed to continue them with me, they are of great ſervice in Scouting, comning Expreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if your Excellency pleaſe to cauſe a Bill to be returned for the hundred Guineys, I ſupplied <hi>Ballderrog:</hi> Or, conſidering ſince my being here I have been at a greater charge, in my Journeys to <hi>Sligoe,</hi> as alſo for Entelligence, which if your Excellency would vouchſafe to make it up 15 <abbr>l.</abbr> it would do me a great kindneſs. I am in due Obedience.</p>

               <p>For the better underſtanding of the following <hi>Diſcourſe, 'tis to be underſtood,</hi> that Coll. <hi>Michelburne</hi> had brought the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Sligoe</hi> to Articles, which were approved on by General <hi>Ginkell,</hi> and Signed and Sealed: The Garriſon was to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to the ſaid Collonel the 15th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt paſt; but for the falſeneſs of <hi>O Donnel</hi> who was then on Capitulation with General <hi>Ginkell,</hi> and ſent to Coll. <hi>Michelburne</hi> to joyn him, if the Garriſon ſhould prove Obſtinate, and ſo to reduce them by force. The General ordered Coll. <hi>Michelburne</hi> to pay him 200 Guineas, as a Mark of his Favours, of which accordingly he paid him 100, and the other 100 he promiſed to pay him in two or three Days; but the ſaid <hi>O Donnel,</hi> notwithſtanding his Ingagement with the General, the payment of the 100 Guineas, he appeared the only perſon that obſtructed the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, and took part with the Garriſon of <hi>Sligoe</hi> to defend them apainſt Coll. <hi>Michelburne,</hi> or what other the General ſhould ſend, Signing an Inſtrument under his Hand, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any Contract made between the General <hi>Ginkell</hi> and himſelf, his only deſign was to prolong the time; and what he did, or acted was for King <hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt; and promiſed the Garriſon of <hi>Sligoe,</hi> to joyn with them when there was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Lords Juſtices underſtanding the Abuſe that was committed by the ſaid <hi>O Donnel,</hi> iſſued firſt their Order to the Militia of moſt part of the Province of <hi>

               <p>This day being <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and proving very wet, was Imployed in cutting Fagots, and repairing the Fort, ſo that we made no Advance, till about Nine next Morning the Coll. viewed every part of the Enemies Outwarks, where he might take 'em at the beſt Advantage, they were obſerved about 200 of them hard at work in Levelling an old Ditch, ſome diſtance from the Fort; we were informed by ſome of the Country, that they had taken a reinforcement of two Foot Companies, one commanded by Lieut. Coll. <hi>Edward mac Swine,</hi> the other by Capt. <hi>Conn O Neal;</hi> we alſo obſerved great numbers of them going into the Town, and could only diſcover one Company of Granadeers, lodg'd in a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fort, to obſerve our motion. The Enemy ſtill obſerving our Men at work, repairing the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Fort, were now altogether ſecure, not apprehending in the leaſt, that we ſhould fall upon them that Morning, and fully aſſured, that nothing would be done of our ſide till the Lord <hi>Granard</hi> arrived; but in leſs than an hour, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a great miſtake, for about Nine that Morning, the Coll. ordered the Company of the Granadeers, one Troop of Dragoons, and 200 Foot, immediately to draw up under Covert of our Fort; he likewiſe gave Orders for all the Horſe to get ready, and mount with all ſpeed: in the mean time all the Fort was got ready, the Attillery harniſh'd, and ready to march, the Coll. advaneed with the Granadeers, and 200 Foot to ſecure the Ditches, and to beat of the Granadeers that were lodg'd in a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fort near the Enemies Outworks, and at our firſt firing the Enemy quitted the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fort, and made into their Trenches; the Collonel thought now was the time, purſues hard after them, enters their Trenches, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my plays hard on our Horſe with their Cannon, which was rangld on the Hill, oppoſite to the Fort, but with little Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. We proſecuted our Advance, beating them from Ditch to Ditch, ſtill gaining Ground; the Foot were all hot engag'd, but the Enemy ſtill giving way; the Militia Troops were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forward on all occaſions, led on by Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> Maj <hi>Touchburne,</hi> and Cornet <hi>Mead;</hi> the firſt of which is Lieut. of the County of <hi>Dunigall,</hi> the other two, Superviſors of the<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46480:52"/>the Militia of <hi>

Thus in an hours time we became Maſters of all their own Works, and intercepted between them and the Town, ſo that the Town fell into our Hands: Likewiſe the Coll. ſent a Lieut. and Thirty men to guard the Bridges, that no Soldier ſhould enter the Town to plunder, and withal gave Orders that the Gallows ſhould immediately be removed into the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place to hang the firſt Offender, which was an extraordinary Satisfaction to thoſe in the Fort, who expected no leſs than to have their Wives and Children put to the Sword.

               <p>BY the fore-going Narrative, where all things were acted, to the full Satisfaction, as well of the Lords Juſtices, as the General, as by their many Letters do appear; 'tis ſtrange what grounds there could be found out for the calling to Account this Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Truſty Perſon, that the Queen ſhould be acquainted with his great Miſcarriage, and after that, the King in Council; the Order from the Queen was anſwered, in theſe Words, by the Lords Juſtices, in a Letter to the Lord <hi>Nottingham;</hi> as in the Cloſe of the Book.

The Collonel ordered the Quartermaſters to deliver a fat Sheep between each four of their Men, and to be ready to march early the next morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday,</hi> The <hi>3d.</hi> Inſtant, we advanced the ſecond time againſt <hi>Sligo,</hi> and the ſame Orders to be obſerved, as was on <hi>Saturday;</hi> Lieut. <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and 20 Men more were leſt to guard the Baggage, and Prey, which was order'd to march in the Rear; about 12, we took up our former ground, againſt <hi>Sligo;</hi> about 3, Coll. <hi>Michelburne</hi> divided his Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Diviſions, leaving the Major, and Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Right Diviſion, on that ſide; and when the Tide ſerved, led the Leſt Diviſion, forced the Paſſage, over the River, and Beſieged <hi>Sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> on the other ſide; that night he diſpatched away an Expreſs to <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſhannon,</hi> for Ammunition and Bread.</p>

               <p>This evening, Capt. <hi>William Stewart</hi> was ordered to divide what Prey was left, equal, amongſt the Militia, and ſtanding Army; and the ſame night, the Militia ſeized on the whole, as well what belonged to the ſtanding Army, as their own, and intirely Deſerted the Camp, leaving Coll. <hi>Michelburne,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton</hi> (the River being between) in apparent peril of being cut off by the Garriſon; the ſaid Coll. and Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> had left them but 150 Men, each, and a Troop of Dragoons; the Garriſon of <hi>Sligo</hi> being this time 2 Regiments, Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> prevailed with his Men to Deſert, promiſing them a Barrel of Beer, at <hi>Bunccanagh,</hi> the place of his Reſidence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, being the <hi>8th.</hi> Inſtant, the Forces were ordered to decamp, and march back to <hi>Ballyſhannon;</hi> the Coll. ſtaying behind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Charles Hamilton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Steward,</hi> and other Officers of the Militia, with the two Troops of Dragoons, of the ſtanding Army, to obſerve the motion of the Enemy; but finding the Garriſon not inclined to Sally out, about 9 that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drew off, and marched to <hi>Ballyſhannon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which, fore-going Journal, it is diſcovered, that one <hi>Forward,</hi> a Militia Captain, deſerted his Poſt, and not only loſt the taking the Town, that time, but he had like to have been the ruine of thoſe few Forces the Coll. had left with him. About the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he finds the ſaid Capt. <hi>Forward,</hi> at <hi>Ballyſhannon,</hi> and gave order for his Confinement; and for an Example, to the reſt of the Militia, for his Cowardiſe and Miſcemeanours, (it being the third time he ſo unworthily gave the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy Encouragement) ſent the ſaid Capt. <hi>John Forward</hi> Priſoner to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Ginkel,</hi> who ordered him to give in Baile, to anſwer his Miſdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: But, inſtead of being called to an account, he informes the Lords Juſtices, by many ſalſe Allegations, and Affidavits, againſt Coll. <hi>Michel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> and had two Months time to act his Villany, whilſt the Collonel<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46480:63"/>was reducing <hi>Sligo.</hi> And, amongſt the reſt, one <hi>Robb,</hi> a Tobacco-Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, at our Camp, and Confederate with <hi>Forward,</hi> ſwears to 6000 black Cattle, and innumetable Sheep, and Horſes: And as ſoon as the ſalſe Affidavits were made, before the Lords Juſtices, he is ſent away to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to the King and Council; and that all things ſhould have Succeſs, he is ſent to a Counſel as unworthy as themſelves; to enlarge on <hi>Robb</hi>'s Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavit, and on the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> the Petition of <hi>George Robb</hi> was read before the King and Council. And in the Prayer of the Petition, deſires that it may not be returned back into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for that it was there alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which ſhews, that the Villain had no mind it ſhould be there, for that he was ſo well known. And at a Conſpiracy at <hi>Londonderry,</hi> held by <hi>Forward,</hi> and <hi>Vaughan; Vaughan</hi> declared they had laid ſo deep a Foundation for the ruine of him, meaning Coll. <hi>Michelburne,</hi> that it was impoſſible for him to eſcape. But that extraordinary Action, in taking <hi>Sligo,</hi> he was fearful would ſpoil all their meaſures, this was told Coll. <hi>Michelburne,</hi> by Capt. <hi>Henry Hare.</hi> It will not be amiſs to give you the Prayer of his Petition in length.</p>

               <p>To conclude, Here, you ſee, is a juſt and true Account, of Coll <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelburne</hi>'s faithful Diſcharge, of his Duty both to Their Majeſties, and his Country, and as we ſay, <hi>He is a good Soldier, that goes no farther than he is commanded;</hi> and by the fore-going Diſcourſe, he had no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Orders for going againſt <hi>Sligo;</hi> yet when they found he had ſo good Succeſs, they highly applauded him, and incouraged him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute that which he had ſo fortunately begun. For ſays the Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>You cannot do your King a greater Service, then to get that place;</hi> ſays the General, <hi>I have directed</hi> O Donnel <hi>to join you, to endeavour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of</hi> Sligo, <hi>which your good Fortune has already brought to Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> And in another Letter, from his Excellency, he acquaints the Coll. <hi>That he had ordered the Militia, that lay at</hi> Athlone, <hi>to march to the North, and be poſted as he ſhall direct; and after the care you have uſed in this Affair, I am ſorry it did not ſucceed: However, you have done your part very well, and would make a good Addition to your Services, if you could yet find any way for treating with Sir</hi> Teague O Regan, <hi>and getting the place.</hi> You ſee that he ſo treated with Sir <hi>Teague O Regan,</hi> with his drawn Sword, as to beat him out of <hi>Sligo.</hi> Nor in the whole, can there be reaſonably the leaſt ſhadow of complaint, to charge Coll. <hi>Michelburne</hi> with any Miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour through his whole Service; though, there are not wanting, thoſe malicious people, who not only ſtudy to render him little, but if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make him uncapable of ſerving his King or Country, and to have him turned out of His Majeſties Service, and his Regiment broken.</p>
               <p>Such envious Spirits, us true, are at work, and though perhaps his Martial Education has not ſo intirely qualified him for a Courtier, to be ready guard, againſt thoſe ſecret Machinations againſt him: However, he thanks Heaven, that he lives in an Age, where Virme and Honour are their own Supporters, Deſert and Fidelity ſtand their own Court-Friends, and their Foundation too ſtrong to be ſupplanted by Paraſites or Flatterers.
